# To-Do-List
This is a project I have made while learning Python on the JetBrains Academy platform hyperskill.org.
It represents a to-do list manipulation app based on the SQL alchemy.<br>
The functionality is as follows
</p>
    <p>Menu:</p>
    <ls>
      <li>1) Today's tasks - show all the tasks planned for today
      <li>2) Week's tasks - show all tasks for 7 days from today inclusive
      <li>3) All tasks - show all tasks in the database
      <li>4) Missed tasks - show tasks, the deadlines of which have passed
      <li>5) Add task - add new task
      <li>6) Delete task - delete the tast
      <li>0) Exit - exit the programm
    </ls>
